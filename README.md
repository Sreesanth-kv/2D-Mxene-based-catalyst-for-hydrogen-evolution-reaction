# MXenes4HER
The global challenges like energy crisis and envirnomental problems need to be addressed. Hydrogen being a clean energy source, can be a sustainable replacement of fossil fuels which are responsible for these issues. However, it is obtained from electrochemical water-splitting which uses expensive and scarce platinum group metals. 
MXenes, 2D transition metal carbides/nitrides/borites can be used as catalysts for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER). 

# MXenes2Code
Here, we provide the code to build the best model that can be used to predict the Gibbs Free Energy (target property) of the MXenes, which is a direct measure of their catalytic activity. It consists of a step-wise procedure to predict the Gibbs Free Energy of all 4,500 MXenes considered.
The list of all the features are available in the dataset. Gibbs Free Energy of 1,125 MXenes were calculated using density functional theory in order to train the model.
The best models can be found in the zip folder, that can be further used for prediction of similar MXene type proving the selected input features (key descriptors).
