# MXenes4HER
The global challenges like energy crisis and envirnomental issues need to be addressed. Hydrogen being a clean energy source, can be a sustainable replacement of fossil fuels. However, it is obtained from electrochemical water-splitting which uses expensive and scarce platinum group metals. 
MXenes, 2D transition metal carbides/nitrides/borites can be used as catalysts for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER). 
Here we provide the code to find the better catalysts by predicting their Gibbs Free Energy, which is a direct measure of their catalytic activity. 

# MXenes2Code
It consists of a step-wise procedure to predict the Gibbs Free Energy of all 4,500 MXenes considered.
